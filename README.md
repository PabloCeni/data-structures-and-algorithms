# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository was created to study and consolidate knowledge about **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

The content is based on courses, readings, and hands-on practice, including:
- Study notes and summaries  
- Code implementations  
- Concept explanations  
- Solved exercises and problems  

The material is added **progressively** as the studies evolve and may be reorganized or improved over time.

This is a **living repository**, focused on learning, practice, and continuous improvement.
